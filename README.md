# Income-Prediction
The goal of the project is to create a classification model to identify the individuals with a potential of earning more than $50,000 USD. The response variable is a binary classifier that will identify whether a person will make $50k and the predictor variables are census information like age, marital status, education etc. We would like to identify the significance of the variables that were used as predictors. A couple of classification techniques were used to compare the accuracy of the classification. The focus of this project will be more on the interpretation and less on implementing a classification algorithm from scratch.
